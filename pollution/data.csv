Slurry,1839,"The huge amounts of manure produced by livestock animals produce contributes to making this the biggest offender when it comes to farm pollution. The average UK dairy cow produces 105lb of faeces each day. The manure is mixed with water to make slurry, which is stored in lagoons or tanks on farms before being used as a fertiliser.  If it leaks from its storage, or runs off land into streams or drains during spreading, slurry can get into waterways, spreading bacteria (which can be anti-biotic resistant) and causing algal bloom which depletes oxygen supplies, suffocating fish and plants. "
Odours,421,"Odours are produced on farms by the animals themselves and their manure, and from the spreading of slurry on fields as fertiliser. The manure contains ammonia, which has a pungent odour, and sulphate, which can smell like rotting eggs. The smell from farms is often stronger if the farmer uses a splash-plate - a trailer which attaches to the slurry tank in order to spray slurry on the fields. In windy conditions this can cause the slurry to enter the air as a vapour."
Wastes,457,"Sometimes farmers get rid of their rubbish inappropriately, or they can be victims of illegal dumping known as fly-tipping. Environment Agency records detail a large variety of materials and wastes being dumped by farmers or on farms, including 120 incidents of construction and demolition materials."
Silage,292,"Silage liquid is the effluent from compacted and fermented crops that is stored in order to feed livestock in winter. It is highly acidic and corrosive, causing devastating effects on land, waterways and wildlife even in small quantities. It also contains chemicals such as ammonia, nitrates, phosphorus and organic carbons which suck up all the oxygen if they get into water, suffocating fish and plants."
Smoke,233,"Smoke pollution incidents were reported 222 times while 11 incidents involving fumes were recorded. Smoke is produced from burning waste on farms while fumes are released if the farmer is using chemicals or has not properly sealed stores of fermenting silage or slurry."
Air,186,"Atmospheric pollutants are produced during livestock farming. Unlike smoke and fumes they may not be visible. Animal manure and slurry lets off ammonia, which combines with pollution from vehicle engines to create tiny solid particles, or aerosols. Ammonia is a greenhouse gas and can also cause heart or lung disease in humans if breathed in regularly. Other greenhouse gases include nitrous oxide and carbon released by fertilisers, decaying crops or when animal dung and urine is mixed with straw or soil. Cows also release carbon dioxide and methane when they digest their food."
Water,162,"Dirty water was reported 162 times. It can contain chemicals used for cleaning, bacteria found around the farm, and substances like slurry or fuel. Waste water from the cleaning of milking parlours is particularly polluting as it contains chlorine and milk.  If milk gets into a waterway the bacteria that feed off it use up oxygen and so its presence can kill fish, plants and other animals."
Manure,120,"Used as a fertiliser, solid manure can have a similar effects to slurry if it enters a local water supply. It also produces odour and attracts flies and vermin."
Soils,87,"Pollution involving soil and clay can be the result of over-tilling - digging and turning the soil with a machine. This loosens the soil so it is unable to properly hold liquid, causing it to crumble and possibly fall on roads or into rivers. Soil and clay can contain fertilisers and bacteria which can pollute waterways in a similar way to slurry."
Fuels,72,"Farms keep stores of fuels such as diesel to use in vehicles like tractors and quad bikes, as well as gas and oils for use in machinery. If the container holding the fuel leaks or collapses it can flow into waterways, killing fish and plants and making it dangerous to drink."
